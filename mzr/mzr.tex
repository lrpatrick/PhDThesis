\chapter{Calibrating the Mass-metallicity relation with RSGs}
\label{ch:mzr}

\textbf{Completeness:} \textbf{0\%} \\


\textbf{Description:} \\
This chapter will be a compilation of the three science chapters I have
where I will estimate the mass-metallictiy relatioship using RSGs.

I will compare this with other estimates of the MZR in the local universe and
identify which of the high-z calibrations best match our local measurements.
