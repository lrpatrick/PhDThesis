\label{sec:introduction}

NGC\,55 is a galaxy located outside of the Local Group of Galaxies within the Sculptor Group at a distance of 1.94\,$\pm$\,0.03\,Mpc~\citep{2006AJ....132.2556P,2008ApJ...672..266G} which, before the emergence of the Araucaria Project~\citep{2005Msngr.121...23G}, had been subject to considerable uncertainty~\citep[e.g.][]{1987ApJ...323...79P,2006A&A...455..891V}.

The Sculptor Group is considered to be the closest group of galaxies to our own and offers a fantastic laboratory with which to test theories of stellar and galactic evolution as using an 8-m class telescope, one can resolve individual stars within this group.
Association to the Sculptor group however, is a contentious issue.
Distance estimates vary to each galaxy, but typically when one references this group the main galaxies associated to this reference are: NGC\,55, NGC\,247, NGC\,253, NGC\,300 and NGC\,7793.
Where NGC\,253 is a large starbust galaxy which is the brightest and most dominant galaxy within this group.
In addition to these five large spiral galaxies, there are also numerous ($\sim$20) dwarf galaxies associated to this group.

By revising distances for nine of these dwarfs~\cite{2003A&A...404...93K} postulated that the Sculptor group was actually more like a filament of galaxies, which intersects the Milky Way group, where NGC\,55 and NGC\,300 and their surrounding satellite galaxies were potentially not associated with the main group of galaxies in this filament.
Regardless of the geometry and association to the Sculptor Group, NGC\,55 is the nearest large galaxy to the MW group in the direction of the Sculptor Group.

The morphology of NGC\,55 is asymmetric and complicated owing to the high inclination angle~\cite[up to 80\textdegree;][]{1986A&A...166...97H,2013MNRAS.434.3511W}.
\cite{1961ApJ...133..405D} classified this galaxy as an LMC-like spiral barred galaxy (SB(s)m) where the bar is seen along the line of sight~\cite{1961ApJ...133..405D}
prompting various claims that this galaxy is an edge on analogue of the LMC~\citep[e.g.][although not cited heavily -- two citations in 50 years -- the idea has propagated]{1964IAUS...20..276R}.
Figure~\ref{fig:ngc55-wide} shows NGC\,55 and its complicated morphology where one can see the edge-on disk along the major axis of the galaxy and the brighter central part of the galaxy represents the head of the bar.
In addition, to NGC\,55 being orientated nearly edge on, extending from the disk-bar system there exists many star formation features such as giant H\,\2 regions as well as supergiant filaments and shells which are thought to allow ionising radiation to be transported to the halo where star-formation is currently occurring~\citep{1996AJ....112.2567F}.

 \label{fig:ngc55-wide}
\end{figure}


The morphology of NGC\,55, as well as its known population of massive hot stars~\citep{2008A&A...485...41C,2012A&A...542A..79C}, points to a recent history of intense star formation.
This is supported by the infrared morphology of NGC\,55 which is dominated by young star forming features~\citep[][with a star formation rate of 0.22\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$]{2004ApJS..154..248E} as well as indications from near-IR imaging~\citep{2005ApJ...622..279D}.

The metal content of NGC\,55 is expected to be LMC-like, which is supported by~\cite{2012A&A...542A..79C} who measured metallicities of 12 blue supergiants using optical spectroscopy and found a mean metallicity [Z]~=~$-$0.40\,$\pm$\,0.13\,dex.
In addition,~\cite{1983MNRAS.204..743W} measure abundances of seven H\,\2 regions across the disk of NGC\,55 using the strong-line method (as well as four measurements of the auroral ``direct'' line method) and found a similar LMC-like metallicity.

Even though the hot massive star population of NGC\,55 has been explored,
there currently exists no confirmed RSGs in NGC\,55, although ~\cite{2005ApJ...622..279D} note that the near-IR CMDs of fields within the disk of NGC\,55 reveal signatures of RSGs.
This study represents the first quantitative study of RSGs in NGC\,55 and, by measuring metallicities of this population, will provide a crucial test of the metallicity gradient within this galaxy.

In this chapter I describe the observations undertaken in Section~\ref{sec:obs} and highlight the target selection method and its uncertainties.
Section~\ref{sec:data_reduction} details the data reduction process and its complications owing to the poor S/N ratios of the observations.
I then present the main results of the chapter in Section~\ref{sec:results} where I first measure radial velocities for each epoch of the RGSs, confirming their membership to NGC\,55, and then go on to measure stellar parameters for each target using the $J$-band analysis technique described in detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:janal}.
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} presents a discussion of the results and the main conclusions are presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Observations} % (fold)
\label{sec:obs}

The observations for this study were taken using three nights of KMOS guaranteed time observations (GTO) containing xx RSG candidates, the first of which was taken in October 2013 as part of the observations which led to the publication of~\cite{2015ApJ...805..182G}.
These data consisted of six science exposures (S) of 600\,s with sky offset exposures (S) interleaved in an O, S, O observing pattern.
Seeing conditions for these data were good at 0\farcs8--1\farcs2 throughout the course of the observing block (OB).

The second data set which is made use of in this chapter comes from two nights in September 2014 where the OB used in 2013 was used as backup observations for a programme which required excellent seeing ($<$\,0\farcs6).
The seeing limits on our observations are more relaxed ($<$\,1\farcs5) which gave us an opportunity to make use of some slightly poorer quality KMOS data.
On the first night in September 2014 where this OB was observed, the seeing conditions varied widly ($>$\,1\farcs6) prompting one observer to comment that ``this is the worst recorded seeing at Paranal!''.
However, there are 24 science exposures where the seeing conditions were better than 2\farcs2, which are (potentially) useful.
The final night of observing consisted of 12 exposures with seeing conditions varying between 1\farcs1--1\farcs6.

In addition to the science exposures obtained, on each night a standard set of KMOS calibration files were obtained as well as standard star observations on each night.
The standard star observing block for each night is slightly different where in October 2013 HIP\,3820~\citep[B8\,V;][]{1978mcts.book.....H} was observed using the 24-arm telluric template (KMOS\_spec\_acq\_stdstarscipatt).
However, in September 2014 only the three-arm telluric template was observed (KMOS\_spec\_cal\_stdstar), this time with HIP\,18926~\citep[B3\,V;][]{1988mcts.book.....H} and HIP\,3820 on both nights.

\textbf{interestingly both with radial velocity measurements. Could do some nice calibration of the RV measurements? or update their measurements ... remember, we've chosen them to be featureless in this region}

Table~\ref{tb:55res} shows the mean measured resolution and resolving power, at the appropriate rotator angles, for each night where the NGC\,55 data were taken.
This table shows that the resolution can vary significant between each night, particularly on detector three where the mean resolving power changes by a factor of 1/5.

\subsection{Target Selection} % (fold)
\label{sub:target_selection}

In order to select RSG candidates in NGC\,55 I compiled optical photometry from two sources: The Araucaria Project~\citep{2005Msngr.121...23G} and the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury project~\citep[ANGST][]{2009ApJS..183...67D}.
Figure~\ref{fig:ngc55-foot} displays the footprints of the two projects.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe the two projects and their limitations:
  \item Araucaria: Wide field ground-based with the aim of measuring distances using Cephieds and BSGs
  \item ANGST: deeper HST survey of nearby (<4\,Mpc) galaxies covering some of the disk in NGC\,55.
  \item Selected based on cuts in the ANGST photometry and then applied to the ground based survey
\end{itemize}

 \label{fig:ngc55-foot}
\end{figure}

Targets were selected based on the optical photometry from the Araucaria Project~\citep{2005Msngr.121...23G}.
The optical CMD which is used to select targets is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:VI}, where the RSG candidates are within the grey box and the observed targets are highlighted in red.
This method of target selection was chosen based on the limited extent of near-IR photometry in this area.
Figure~\ref{fig:ngc55} displays the footprints from the Araucaria Project
(green) and the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury~\citep[blue; ANGST][]{2009ApJS..183...67D} in NGC\,55 overlaid on a --- image.

The selection criteria employed in this study makes use of the optical $V-I$ colours and $m_I$ magnitudes.
Owing to their cool temperatures and extreme luminosities RSGs are known to exist in a ``plume'' at the tip of a structure of cool stars in the $V-I$, $m_I$ CMD~\citep.
Figure~\ref{fig:VI} displays this CMD and the region of parameter space where RSG candidates reside is marked with a grey box.
This box has the limits $17 < m_I < 19$ and $1.2 < V-I < 3.5$ following~\cite{2015ApJ...805..182G}.
The lower limit of this box are naturally blended in to a population of super-AGB stars which can have luminosities comparable to the faintest RSGs~\citep[e.g.]{2000ApJ...542..804N}.
However, as stated in Chapter~\ref{ch:n6822} these stars are known to have lifetimes similar to the lowest mass RSGs and arguably still trace the young stellar population of this galaxy.

Table~\ref{tb:n55obs-params} shows ground- and space-based optical photometry of the KMOS targets along with their radial velocities (see section~\ref{sub:rvs}).

\section{Data Reduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:data_reduction}

The data reduction was performed with the KMOS/esorex pipeline with a several corrections to improve the quality of the reductions which are fully described and characterised in Turner et al. (in prep).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Split recombined sky frames into seeing bins
    \item combine by including pixel shifts between reconstructed IFUs to ensure all frames are correctly matched
    \item etc.
\end{itemize}

Would it be useful to use Skycorr to subtract the sky as in Gazak et al. (2015)

Telluric correction has been performed by combining and reconstructing the telluric standard exposures using the standard pipeline routines.
To improve the performance of the telluric correction I use the method described in detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:n6822}.

As mentioned above, were multiple standard star OBs for each night of observing.
The telluric spectrum used to correct each science spectrum is determined on a star-by-star basis depending upon a visual inspection of the results of the correction.

\subsection{Radial Velocities} % (fold)
\label{sub:rvs}
Radial velocities are measured using the method described first in Chapter~\ref{ch:n2100} where radial velocities are measured using several strong spectral features within the 1.16-1.21\,$\mu$m region.
Each of these spectral features is independently used to measure a radial velocity where the value quoted is the average of these measurements and the uncertainties are defined by the standard deviation of the measurements.
This method is known to work well on KMOS stellar spectra~\cite{2015ApJ...798...23L,2015ApJ...803...14P,2016arXiv160202702P}.

Estimated radial velocities from each KMOS pointing is listed in Table~\ref{tb:n55obs-params} alongside the average radial velocity for each target, where any significantly discrepant measurement has been excluded (marked by note c in Table~\ref{tb:n55obs-params}).
Uncertainties quoted on the average are the standard deviation of the measurements on each night.

The average radial velocity of the sample is 199\,$\pm$\,16\,\kms.
Three targets (NGC55-RSG22, NGC55-RSG36 and NGC55-RSG60) have been excluded from this average based on their unreliable radial velocity estimates.
Given the significant variability in these measurements on each night, an assessment on membership to NGC\,55 is impossible given the current data.

Comparing the average velocity to the H\,\1 systemic velocity~\citep[$v_{sys}$~=~129.0\,$\pm$\,2.0\,\kms][]{2004AJ....128...16K} of NGC\,55 there appears to be a significant offset.
However, NGC\,55 is known to contain significant velocity structure~\citep[e.g. Figure 5 in][]{1991AJ....101..447P} and given the location of the observed field with respect to the centre of the galaxy, this average velocity is in agreement with previous measurements.

As the observed data is taken over four different epochs, the variability of each source can crudely be assessed. No clear evidence for variability is found for any target within the observed sample.
The probability that each measurement is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centred on the average value for each target is computed and no measurement has a probability lower than x.xx per cent of being associated with the corresponding distribution.

The average radial velocities for each target is shown against the projected radial distance from the centre of NGC\,55 in Figure~\ref{fig:RvsRV}.



Distance modulus~=~26.58\,$\pm$\,0.11~\citep{2011ApJ...738..150T}
