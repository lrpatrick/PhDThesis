\chapter{Red Supergiants in NGC\,55}

\textbf{Completeness:} \textbf{30\%} \\
The observations for this section are complete and the data reduction is
currently being optimised.

\textbf{Description:} \\
This chapter will outline KMOS observations of 20 RSGs in NGC\,55.
I will descibe the work I have done in preperation for these observations.

I will discuss the optimisations which have been made for this data set and
describe the challenges of obtaining the best possible data from a set of
challenging observations.

I will comment on the spatial distribution of the chemical abundances in this
galaxy and discuss a potential metallicity gradient previously suggested in
the literature.
