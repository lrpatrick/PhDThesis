Questions:

# Intro

-- What is re-ionisation of the Universe?

-- What is optical depth and why is it important?

-- How does measuring the width of the MS put constraints upon convection?

-- What has changed in Fig 1.2 since Smartt 2009?
    -- e.g./i.e. role of binaries in influencing Ibc channels etc
    -- LBVs

-- How does the rotation impact on the observed KMOS frames?

‘adiabatic temp gradient’ feels a bit dangling (which is fine as you can’t explain *everything*, but this is the sort of thing where you might get a follow-up question of what you mean by this)

Why do I fit the continuum differently to Davies et al. 2015?

Why do I struggle fitting low logg values?
