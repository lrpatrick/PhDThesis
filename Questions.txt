Questions:

# Intro

1. What is optical depth and why is it important?

2. How does measuring the width of the MS put constraints upon convection?


How does the rotation impact on the observed KMOS frames?

‘adiabatic temp gradient’ feels a bit dangling (which is fine as you can’t explain *everything*, but this is the sort of thing where you might get a follow-up question of what you mean by this)

Why do I fit the continuum differently to Davies et al. 2015?

Why do I struggle fitting low logg values?
