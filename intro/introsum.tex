\chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{Completeness:} \textbf{85\%} \\
This estimation is based on the work done in the first year report.

\textbf{Description:} \\
The introduction will be split into three main sections:

1. The life and death of massive stars\\
Where I will outline the physical processes of the birth,
the evolution from the onset of hydrogen fusion and finaly the death of massive stars focusing in particular on the Red Supergiant phase of stellar evolution

2. The Physical Properties of Red Supergiants\\
I will detail the properties of RSGs from Galactic studies and outline our
present understanding of what a RSG is and some of their characteristic features
e.g. mass loss rates.

3. The Chemical evolution of galaxies\\
In this section I will give an account of how galaxies build up their present
abundances via star formation and feedback.
I will describe the mass-metallicity relationship and how RSGs will play a role
in furthering our understanding of this relationship.
