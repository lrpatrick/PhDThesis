\chapter{Near-IR selection of Red Supergiants}

\textbf{Completeness:} \textbf{30\%} \\
Observations complete, still currently working with the pipeline team to fix,
the data reduction pipeline for this instrument.

\textbf{Description:} \\
This chapter will discuss how to select RSGs based on their near-IR properties.
A more robust selection criteria will be establised based on a J-band colour-
magnitude diagram.
These results will be tested on a set of observations in M33 where effectiveness
of the technique will be estimated.

These results will be compared to the recently developed \textquoteleft
Q-parameter\textquoteright.
