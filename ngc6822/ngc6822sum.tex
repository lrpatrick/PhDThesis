adapted and expanded into a thesis chapter

\textbf{Description:} \\
This chapter describes the observations of RSGs in NGC\,6822 a local dwarf
irregular galaxy. This chapter details the observations obtained with KMOS
and the data reduction process as well as what has been optimsied in this process
for our observations.
Target selection is based on that described in a previous chapter

The analysis for this section is that described in a previous chapter.

The results of this chapter are that we obtain stellar parameters for 11 RSGs
in this galaxy and quantify the lack of stellar metallicity gradient within
this galaxy.
We show that our results compare well to previous estimates of stellar
metallicity from young stars and HII regions in this galaxy.
Using a simple chemical evolution model we show that the present-day
metallicity can be explained in terms of the simple closed-box chemical
evolution model which is remakrable give the morphology of this galaxy.
Finally we compare the stellar parameters derived in this study with all those
derived using the same technique in different environments.
We show that there appears to be no significant variation of temperature of RSGs
with respect to metallicity, in direct contrast with recent evolutionary models.
