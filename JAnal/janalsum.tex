\chapter{J-band Sythentic Spectral Fitting}

\textbf{Completeness:} \textbf{60\%} \\
My implementation of the J-band spectral fitting technique is in the final
stages of testing and has performed well in a variety of tests.
More testing still remains before I can use this implementation confidently
on a new data set.

In tandem to developing this implementation of the technique I have also
documented my progress which will serve as the bones of this chapter.

\textbf{Description:} \\
This chapter will describe in detail the process by which one can estimate
stellar parameters based on near-IR spectra of Red Supergiant stars.
I will document the progress to date using this technique and describe how
my implementation will allow an independent check to results which have
been obtained using other implementations of the same technique.

I will focus in particular on the differences between my implementation and
those in the literature.
