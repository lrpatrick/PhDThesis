\chapter{Red Supergiants in NGC\,2100}

\textbf{Completeness:} \textbf{60\%} \\
The observations and data reduction for this section are complete.
I am currently polishing the analysis for this chapter and a have a draft of a paper almost ready.

\textbf{Description:} \\
This chapter will describe KMOS observations of 14 RSGs in NGC\,2100.

I will describe the cluster and outline the connection between YMCs and GCs and the potential
for constraints on GC properties by studying YMCs.

I will estimate the dynamical and chemical properties of NGC\,2100 and comment on the
evolution of young clusters in general.
